# Project Synapse: My Data Science Journey

**Mission:**  
I created this repository as a transparent record of my disciplined, 12 to 18-month journey to become a well-rounded data scientist. This space documents my learning process, showcases my projects, and reflects my commitment to understanding fundamentals and applying them to real-world problems.

**Status:** `Phase 1: In Progress`

---

## Why I’m Doing This

I realized that mastering data science is about more than just knowing which tools to use. It's about understanding the underlying principles and being able to apply them thoughtfully. My goal is to build deep intuition, solve meaningful problems, and communicate insights clearly.

Here’s what guides me:

1. **Start with the Why:** I focus first on understanding the logic behind a concept before moving on to implementation.
2. **Learn by Building:** Applying knowledge through projects helps reinforce my understanding.
3. **Explain Clearly:** I strive to make complex ideas accessible, both for myself and others.

## The Roadmap

I've mapped out a five-phase plan to guide my progress:

- **Phase 1: Foundations (Months 1-3):** Building strong intuition in linear algebra, calculus, and statistics.
- **Phase 2: Tooling Up (Months 4-6):** Deepening proficiency with Python, core data libraries like Pandas and NumPy, and Git.
- **Phase 3: Core Data Science (Months 7-10):** Exploring the theory and application of essential machine learning algorithms.
- **Phase 4: Projects & Portfolio (Months 11-14):** Developing a portfolio of end-to-end data science projects.
- **Phase 5: Specialization & Job Prep (Months 15-18):** Diving into NLP, computer vision, and preparing for interviews.

## What’s Inside

You’ll find three main folders:

- [`/01_foundations`](./01_foundations): My working notes and iterative code as I explore each foundational concept.
- [`/02_projects`](./02_projects): End-to-end projects, each with its own README detailing objectives, process, and key outcomes.
- [`/03_case_studies`](./03_case_studies): Analytical studies of specific problems or business cases, connecting theory to practical solutions.

**Current Focus:**  
`Phase 1 > Linear Algebra > Vectors & Matrices`

## Notes

- Setup instructions will be added as needed for reproducibility.
- If you’re also learning or notice something that could be improved, I welcome your feedback or questions.
- This repository will evolve over time as I continue to grow and refine my approach.
