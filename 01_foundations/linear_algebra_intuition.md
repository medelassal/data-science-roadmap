 A matrix's fundamental purpose is to describe a transformation of space. It does this by telling us where the original basis vectors land after the change. For example, in 2D, the first column of the matrix tells us the new coordinates of (i-hat), and the second column tells us the new coordinates of (j-hat). So, the matrix is like a compact set of instructions that encodes the entire transformation.
